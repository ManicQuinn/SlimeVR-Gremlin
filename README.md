# Gremlin Trackers
A case design based on a [Stacked Smol-Slime](https://github.com/LyallUlric/Stacked-SmolSlime) layout, with a slide tray and a charging dock(Planned).

## To Do List:

- [X] Reverse clips. (Clips on Case)
- [X] ~~Simplify lid wedge into a sharp wedge and not what it is now with a flat side. (Don't worry, this is not confusing)~~ (This got too hard, so I gave up)
- [X] Get a prototype printed and sent to make measurement revisions, proving hard to do through others.
- [X] Remove charging hole on tray.
- [X] ~~Attempt a plug that closes the button when not pressed, same reasoning as #4.~~ (This requires knowledge of slicing the print, so on hold for now)
- [X] Add a lil standoff on the end of the lid to limit it at the end of the tray. (Added a standoff on battery side)
- [X] Reduce the thickness around the antenna.
- [X] Change slide tab design to reduce overhang print stress.
- [X] Increase tab strength. (0.05)
- [X] Increase vertical tolerances for NRF. (0.2)
- [X] Fix rocking issues on lid, slight design change required. (Tried only to reduce tolerances of tabs that push down on components, also added a standoff on battery side, finally redid the position of the top tab so we can have all tabs available)
- [X] ~~Fix button tolerance, seems to meld together.~~ (Irrelevant for due to redesign)
- [X] Add holes for soldering points on both case and lid. (0.8mm extrusions, needs more for the IMU on lid)
- [X] Simplify button compliant mechanism.
- [X] Double check lid tolerances with case.
- [X] Increase USB Hole height a lil
- [X] Increase height of case by maybe 0.1mm
- [X] Fix vertical(0.05mm) and horizontal extrusions on Case not matching up with extrusions of Tray. (Move sketches and Extrudes)
- [X] Fix Lid Extrusions to match Design.
- [X] Fix bottom not having a curve from last iteration
- [X] Redo Lid tabs, not satisfied with the click.
- [X] Figure out a fix for button falling off.
- [X] Change angles and measurements of strap loops to accommodate for the bottom curve.
- [X] Reduce tolerances of tray clips to fix them having too much give.
- [X] Optimize case design for lid.
- [X] Add parameters for certain measurements.
- [X] ~~Create a calibration cube.~~ (Not needed)
- [ ] Create a tray for a chest tracker.
- [X] Do a test print; Test Fragility of new strap loops, test the give of the tray/slide, test new button. (Brass ðŸ©·)
- [ ] Work on aesthetics.
